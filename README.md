# 03 Password-Generator

For this project, I had to create a password generator that would select a random combination of characters based on what criteria the user has input. Through the use of JavaScript, I was able to generate unpredictable passwords which would provide greater security for the user. 



## User Story

 To randomly generate a password by answering prompts based on a set of a criteria outlined in the code.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
